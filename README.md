# Refactoring my skills

This repository contains the source code related to my studies of Algorithms, Data Structures, Java, etc. I'm currently working to refactor my skills, and my goal here is to become a better professional, by reviewing the basic Computer Science that I learnt at the University (a long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away ... ).

The repository contains 3 sections:

-   `assignments`: contains the programming assignments solved on platforms such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com), [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com), etc.
-   `tools`: contains scripts to run the assignments in a similar way that they run on the platforms.
-   `training`: contains code related to tutorials, articles, tests, etc.


## Running the assignments code

I'm building my code using Java, so I built a small script to build, run and the assignment code, using an input/output file to check the result.


### Running assignments with input and output file

For instance, suppose that you want to run the code at `assignments/hackerrank/algorithms/dynamic-programming/the-coin-change-problem`. You can run the following commands:

```sh
cd assignments/hackerrank/the-coin-change-problem
../../../tools/runner-java input1.txt output1.txt
```

You should see the following output:

```
╰─$ ../../../tools/runner-java input1.txt output1.txt
Compiling Solution.java ...
----------------------------------------
Code compiled!

Running Solution ...
----------------------------------------

real	0m0.142s
user	0m0.126s
sys	0m0.037s

Checking output ...
----------------------------------------
Test passed!
```


### Running assignments with output file only

For method only assignments, you might want to run your solution using a programmatic input. For instance, suppose that you want to run the code at `assignments/hackerrank/data-structures/trees/preorder-traversal`. You can run the following commands:

```sh
╰─$ runner-java-no-input output.txt                                       1 ↵
Compiling Solution.java ...
----------------------------------------
Code compiled!

Running Solution ...
----------------------------------------
3 5 1 4 2 6

real   	0m0.171s
user   	0m0.117s
sys    	0m0.028s

Checking output ...
----------------------------------------
Test passed!
```
